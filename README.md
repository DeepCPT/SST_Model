# Consumer Preference Transformer (CPT)

## Introduction

The Consumer Preference Transformer (CPT) is a novel deep learning framework designed to model and capitalize on consumers' dynamic preferences, integrating the principles of deep learning with economic theories of sequential search. This model offers a unique approach by not only predicting consumer behaviors such as clicks and purchases but also providing interpretable insights into the decision-making processes of consumers.

## Background

Traditional deep learning methods offer robust predictive capabilities when dealing with complex consumer data but often lack interpretability. Conversely, economic theories like the sequential search model provide a structured understanding of consumer behavior but do not leverage the potential of modern machine learning technologies. CPT bridges this gap by combining these two domains into a cohesive modeling framework.

## Model Description

CPT uses deep learning to learn dynamic consumer preferences and adapts the economic theory of sequential search to model the process of consumer search and purchase decisions. This integration allows the model to be transparent and interpretable, explaining the consumer's decision-making process in detail.

## Features

- **Integration of Deep Learning and Economic Theory:** Leverages the strengths of both areas to provide a comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior.
- **End-to-End Learning:** Enables efficient training of the model on large datasets, facilitating the capture of complex consumer dynamics.
- **Interpretability:** Opens the black box of traditional deep learning models by incorporating economic theory that explicitly models consumer decisions.
- **Empirical Validation:** Demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art deep learning and structural econometric models in predicting consumer actions.

## Policy Experiments

CPT facilitates the assessment of various intervention policies. Empirical experiments show that implementing CPT-based product and attribute recommendation strategies can significantly enhance the effectiveness of product recommendations and new product promotions, leading to improved user experiences and increased business revenues.
